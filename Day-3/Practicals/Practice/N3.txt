Day-3
-------------------------------------------------------
1). First, I had performed the Clone operation to bring my Private
    Remote Repo into my local System

2). Then performed various Branch creating and Merging Operation.

3). I had create one branch named as a "development" from main branch,
    and now it contin the repository of the main branch.

4). I had also create another branch named as a "Test" branch from the 
    "development" branch and now it contains the Repo of development branch.

5). I had create one file named as "Sample3.html" in "Day3/Practicals" folder 
    in my local system and push this change into Remote System.

6). Merge --> From development to main
    And then, I had Merged from "development" branch to Main branch which 
    make possible to bring the changes of "development" into my "Main" branch.

7). And I'm navigating the Branches through Checkout command in which i had 
    to choose those branch, in which i would like to navigate to.

8). Reverse Merge -->From main to development
    first i had made changes in the main file and merge from main to development 
    to reflect.

9). When I made Changes in a index3.html of both "main" branch and "development" branch
    in the same line it throws a conflict.

10).So, to resolve this conflict, I had Merged both the branches and Accept the
    Changes of both branch in "index3.html" file of "development" branch only.

11). I had performed this Merging Task on Day3/Practicals Folder of this private 
     Repository.
