SVN Learning
____________

SVN - Stands for "Subversion" or "Software Network Version"

SVN is a open source version control system, used for 
versioning and revision.

It is a centralized version control system.

In Centrailzed VCS, their is one central system and the working 
Copy in our local system.

For example, there are different people working on a project,
so they all work on their personal working copy on their local
system and all the member then commiting their changes in that 
one "central Repository or Central System"

First step towards SVN is to install the TortoiseSVN.

I had created one empty folder and by right clicking 
perform the TortoiseSVN, and the logo of the folder was changed.

Created another folder and checkout in that folder.

And, then commited the file by commit option with authentication.
