Self Learning Topic --> 1. Cherrypick
                        2. Rebase

1). Cherrypick 
    ----------
    These Cherrypick concept is used only,if we want a specific commit of one
    branch on the another branch.
    
    Practice
    ________

    In these, I have three branches but I had used development, and test branch
    to perform these cherrypick operation.
    
    So for that purpose, I had first merge both development and test branch.
     
    And make one small change in index4.html of Test branch and commit it as "Commit on changes in index4.html" 
    and using this "git log" command of test branch & copied the address of commit.
    
    And checkout to development branch and run the command "git cherry-pick 3601a53806e6f56758b13f0c92fb858cbd8a4b2b
    (address of the commit)".
   
    After that, the same commit was copied on development branch.
    
    And finally, pushes that all changes in the Remote Repository.


2). Rebase
    --------
    Rebase is a git operation that allows you to rewrite commits 
    from one branch onto another branch.

    Essentially, Git is deleting commits from one branch, and  
    adding it to another branch.

    It is used to maintain a linear project history

    There are two modes of Git Rebase,
    i) Git Rebase Standard - it takes no arguments.

    ii) Git Rebase Interactive - it takes an arguments.
    
    Git Merge vs Git Rebase --> Git Merge shows the group of commits & it also preserves the history of commits.

                                Git Rebase shows the linear sequence of commits, & it vanishes the history.
