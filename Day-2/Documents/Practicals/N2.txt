Day-2
-----------------------------
1). Create one new Repsitory named as a radixdt2022.

2). Create new file as index2.html in that Repository. 

3). Clone that Remote Repo into the Local System Folder
    named as a rxdt.

4). Simply made some Changes in file and also created one 
    another file in local and then push that changes into 
    that Remote Repo.

5). stage--> If we want to commit and make Changes in a 
    particular file then only we use commit stage on that 
    file.
6). stash--> I used this operation so that, I can store 
    my recent changes on the file, and same time I was 
    able to work on the another file 

    i) Here I used the stast operation on sample2.html &
       index2.html and same time working on another file.
    
    ii) After that I had applied stash and got my Changes on
        sample2.html and index2.html files back.

7). Finally Push that changes on Remote Repo From my
     local Repo after applying the stash.
