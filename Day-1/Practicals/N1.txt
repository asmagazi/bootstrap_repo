Day-1 
-------------------------------------
1) Sign in to github account.

2) Created one github Repository named as "Induction22".

3) Also created one file named as "Index1.html" in that Repository.

4) Then created one folder named as "Induction22" in that folder, I wanted 
   to clone my Remote Repository.

5) I had done clone operation using command prompt by performing the below steps:

         i.First set the path.
     
         ii.Then run the command git clone URL(Remote Repository). 

6) Finally these clone operation copy my Remote Repository in the local System.
 
7) Then I had perform various operation & Changes in local & Remote Repository Via 
   the visual Studio code.

8) Pull ---> Then I had performed "Pull" operation, so that I can reflect the changes of Remote 
   Repo in my Local Repo via a VS Code.

9) Push ---> Used this operation to reflect the changes of local Repo into the Remote Repo.

10) I had again made changes in the Remote Repo and also made changes in the local Repo but,
    when I had tried to push the Changes to the Remote Repo the conflict Arise.
   

11) So, the question is that How to resolve these conflict?
    To resolve this conflict first it need to pull the changes then only 
    it is possible to push and a final commit.

12) And here all the file is on main branch by default.

13) URL(RemoteRepo) -----> https://github.com/asmagazi/Induction22.git
